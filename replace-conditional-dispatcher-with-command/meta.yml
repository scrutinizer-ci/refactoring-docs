title: Replace Conditional Dispatcher with Command
initial_situation: Conditional logic is used to dispatch requests and execute actions.
target_situation: Create a Command for each action. Store the Commands in a collection and replace the conditional logic with code to fetch and execute Commands.
difficulty: medium

fixes: [long-method]

pros:
    - "Provides a simple mechanism for executing diverse behavior in a uniform way.\r"
    - "Enables runtime changes regarding which requests are handled and how.\r"
    - 'Requires trivial code to implement.'

cons:
    - 'Complicates a design when a conditional dispatcher is sufficient.'

intro: |
    A conditional dispatcher is a conditional statement (typically ``switch``) which
    is used to route and handle a request.

    Conditional dispatchers are not necessarily bad, some are well suited for the
    task they are performing. This applies mostly to dispatchers which are small, but
    even small Conditional Dispatchers might be better refactored to the Command pattern.

    If one of the following is the case for you, you can benefit from using a Command
    pattern over a Conditional dispatcher:

    - *Need for Runtime Flexibility*: You want to pass in requests which you do not know of (for
      example, because they are provided by third-party libraries).

    - *Long Conditional Dispatchers with big chunks of code*

    The **Command pattern** simply places the action related code into a separate class,
    the Command class. A command class typically has a ``execute`` or ``run`` method.

    If you are not sure yet whether you should keep a Conditional Dispatcher or use
    a Command pattern, keep the Conditional Dispatcher. The Command pattern is very
    easy to refactor to if the need arises.
