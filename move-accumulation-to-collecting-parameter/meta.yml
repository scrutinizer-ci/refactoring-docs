title: Move Accumulation to Collecting Parameter
initial_situation: You have a single big method that writes information to local variables.
target_situation: Instead write results to a Collecting Parameter which gets passed to the extracted methods.
difficulty: easy

fixes: [long-method]

pros:
    - 'Helps split a big method into smaller and easier to understand methods.'

intro: |
    A Collecting Parameter is an object that you pass to methods in order to collect
    information from those methods. Therefore, often this refactoring is combined with
    the :refactoring:`compose-method` refactoring.

    Instead of calling many methods in sequence and collecting their results in
    local variables, you instead pass an object to these methods and the methods
    can store their results in the passed object.

#    This refactoring is very similar to the :refactoring:`move-accumulation-to-visitor`
#    refactoring. A visitor may be the better approach if you collect data from diverse
#    interfaces and classes.
